## Personas

The main choice you’ll be making as you construct your personas is how much information to include for each one. Generally, there are three layers of detail to consider. The most basic personas will only include the first layer, while the most elaborate will flesh out all three layers.

## Layer 1: establishing requirements

* **Name**: Personas are summary representations of people. People have names. Therefore, your personas should have names, if for no other reason than to make it easy to talk about them with other project participants.
* **Key distinguishing feature**: Summarize the persona in a sentence or two to help other people understand what makes them special.
* **Descriptive dimensions**: you want to communicate what users know, what they might do, and what they want to achieve. Even when not using explicit personas.
* **Objectives and motivations**: The artifact should include a set of bullets listing the persona’s goals within the scope of the system.  these goals may be expressed as what users want to get out of interacting with the system, but the goals may also reflect what users want from the organization, or what they want in general
* **Source**: Treat your personas as individual research papers. Be sure to annotate (with footnotes, for example) citing the source of each data point, even if that source is an internal brainstorming session or the opinion of the CEO or VP of marketing

## Layer 2: elaborating relationships

Adding more information to elaborate on the relationships between the personas and the web site.

* **Concerns**: What they care about:  establish what concerns will influence their experience. Keep in mind that a customer’s experience extends beyond the web, or a single session of using the site
The persona can include *questions* from the user’s perspective, and reflect the kinds of things they’re thinking about before, during, or after using the web site.
 a persona can characterize users’ typical *pain points*. These are the areas that tend to give people the most trouble
* **Scenarios and circumstances**: Scenarios are more-or-less realistic scenes that set the stage for an interaction between a web site and a user. They allow project participants to picture the use of the system beyond the system itself, helping them understand how the system fits into their customers’ lives. 

Help project participants identify what information users might have in-hand when they approach the site

## Layer 3: making ’em human

* **Personal background**: Personal background information can flesh out the user and make the persona more accessible to stakeholders and designers. 
* **Photograph**:  a photograph can help stakeholders stop thinking about their customers as a singular anonymous mass and understand that they are people with particular needs 
* **System features**:  You may already have a sense of the features and content the site will include. In this case, you can align these elements with the persona’s motivations to show which features will help users meet their needs.
* **Demographic information**: A holdover from its predecessor, the marketing segment, demographic information is meant to describe the whole category of user, detailing
* **Technology comfort level**: This bit of information is a favorite among first-time persona builders, but the real value of this information is its implications. A user’s comfort level with technology should be translated into actual needs.

## Creating Personas

* **Purpose**: The role of personas:  this will help focus your efforts, but it will also drive what to include and what to leave out in the personas themselves
* **Timeline**: When personas happen:  They can supplement other documents that establish project requirements or—in a pinch—stand on their own
* **Audience**: Who’s looking at the personas:  the format for personas need not vary by audience. Still, some areas of the personas will be more useful to some project participants than others. 

## Tips for Polished Personas

* Create a summary of the personas
* Illustrate relationships between personas
* Facilitate comparisons between personas: Perhaps what matters more than how the personas are derived from each other is how they are different from each other. Highlighting similarities and differences can help establish a prioritization for requirements.
* Show mental models:  incorporating the user’s mental model into personas can be a powerful way to focus designers on what really matters.

## Level up Your Persona skills: 

Personas are pretend people that can really spark the imagination. While this can yield useful insights as you study data from user research and other inputs, it can also be a dangerous rabbit hole. 

* Incorporate actionable information
* Reference your sources
* Represent reality accurately
* Keep personas lean 

## Presenting Personas

Personas are people—abstract summaries of people, but people nonetheless. Remind your guests of honor (the stakeholders) how they might know them and what they have in common—perhaps even why they invited them in the first place.

* Establish a purpose for meeting
* Discussions to clarify personas
* Personas in design reviews
* Selling personas
* Adapt the basic meeting structure

## Using and Applying Personas

Personas are a great way to capture user needs, but they cannot stand on their own. Ideally, your personas must fit into the overall design process.

* **Personas and Design Documents**: Personas are a great way to interject rationale into the design decisions captured in these documents, just as they are with strategy documents
* **Personas and the Design Process**: Without personas, there is no common language for talking about what users want. Project participants with particular agendas may try to squeeze unvetted ideas into the design by saying things like, “Users really want to see…” or “This content is more important to users
* **Personas help make users real people**: In creating personas, the design team creates a common language with which to talk about end users and what they need. They also give you an out: If team members start speculating about users, you can stop the conversation, point to the personas, and refocus the conversation around what is known.
* **Personas help keep the design effort focused**: Vacuous claims about user needs can lead to scope creep. They can lengthen project timelines by encouraging development of features that are not supported by user needs. They can lead to unnecessary compromise. Referring to the personas can help avoid these pitfalls.
* **Personas help organizations internalize user-centeredness**:  the purpose of a persona is to help the design team make decisions about design. The persona takes as input observations about users and structures those observations in a meaningful way.
